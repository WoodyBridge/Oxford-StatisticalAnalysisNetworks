MSc Social Data Science @ Oxford Uni 2018/2019 - Module Statistical Analysis of Networks

This project is my summative for the course Statistical Analysis of Networks.

The code was created for a reasarch paper titled: An Exploratory Network Analysis of Airbnb in London. 

In summary, this code creates a bipartite network between Airbnb hosts and reviewers, and then calculates a number of network specific metrics which are used in statistical tests.

Findings from the paper show the most repeatedly, and least, visted boroughs of London and pererential attachment amongst the degree distribution.
